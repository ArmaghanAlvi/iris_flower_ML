## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to expose myself to basic machine learning concepts and other data manipulation functions in Python.
It uses the libraries of scipy, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and sci-kit learn to load and examine data, then test various different ML classification algorithms, and finally, make some predictions based on the algorithm deemed most effective on this data set. For the evaluation of the algorithms, the program uses stratified 10-fold cross validation.
The final_model file simply runs the most effective model that was determined in the main file.

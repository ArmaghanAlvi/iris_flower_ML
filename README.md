## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to expose myself to basic machine learning concepts and other data manipulation functions in Python.
The main focuses were to learn how to load and examine data, test various different ML classification algorithms and determine the most effective, and finally, make some predictions for unseen data based on the algorithm deemed most effective on the data set. For the evaluation of the algorithms, the program uses stratified 10-fold cross validation.
The `final_model` file simply runs the most effective model that was determined in the `main` file.

### Built with
**Language used:** Python  

**Python libraries:**
* scipy
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* sci-kit learn


## Lessons
Considering the fact that the entire goal of this project was to learn, there is a lot that I learned from this simple ML program. I learned:
* How to implement various libraries that are useful for ML, data science, etc.
* How to load and read basic data from external files
* How to examine and visually represent data on various plots like box and whisker, scatter, etc.
* About k-fold cross examination; what it is, how it works, and how to implement it
* Various different common ML classification algorithms
* How to display and represent the findings of these algorithms
